# Breast-Cancer-Predictor

Currently, the leading cause of death from cancer among women is breast cancer with the most common
form being Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) (American Cancer Society, 2022). While the number of women
diagnosed with breast cancer is increasing, the conventional methods to diagnose a patient have not been
able to keep up. These methods often rely on the judgment of a medical professional which has found to
be subjective as each professional interprets medical images differently (Handley, 2023). These methods can
also be time consuming and costly to classify manually. There is, therefore, a need for more reliable methods
that are able to more accurately predict the presence of malignancy.

The goal of this project was to use Machine Learning methods to build a model that can predict
malignancy. The training algorithm that I chose for this problem was Convolutional Neural Networks.
I chose this model because it is the best algorithm for image classification. The reason why CNNs are
generaly better for such a problem is that they are able to reduce the dimensionality of input data through
pooling and filtration and since images are data with high dimensions with each pixel representing a feature,
this will reduce the complexity of the model, leading to less complex networks and greater generalization.
